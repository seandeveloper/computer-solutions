Udemy Eduonix's Angular course project 1: Computer solutions business site using bootstrap and angular.js
Stable and working, project completed.

In this project I learned $http get requests that parse a json file and return the data. I did not seperate the files
into different directories for simplicity, However I will return to the project once I know more about separation and
finish the project properly.
